# Vibration Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Vibration Sensor project demonstrates how to detect vibrations using an Arduino Nano and a vibration sensor module. Vibration sensors are commonly used in applications such as security systems, machine health monitoring, and earthquake detection. This project allows you to detect vibrations and trigger an action, such as turning on an LED, in response to detected vibrations.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Vibration Sensor Module**
3. **LED**
4. **Resistor (220 ohms)**
5. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Vibration Sensor and LED to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the vibration sensor module to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the positive (+) terminal of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the negative (-) terminal of the LED to GND (ground) on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the vibration sensor module and LED to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Tap or shake the vibration sensor module to simulate vibrations.
   - Observe the LED turning on when vibrations are detected, and the corresponding message in the serial monitor.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Use vibration sensors to detect unauthorized access or tampering in security systems.
- **Machine Health Monitoring:** Implement vibration sensors in machinery to monitor vibration levels and detect abnormalities indicating potential faults.
- **Seismic Activity Monitoring:** Use vibration sensors in earthquake detection systems to detect and measure seismic activity.

#### Notes

- Adjust the sensitivity of the vibration sensor module if necessary to detect vibrations effectively.
- Experiment with different threshold levels and debounce times to optimize the performance of the vibration detection system for your specific application requirements.
